# Can You Always Love What You Do? (feat. 'Passing Through Failure')

Maybe it’s because I’ve been alone lately, but my emotions have been a roller coaster. In the middle of work, I suddenly ask myself, *"What should I do in life to be truly happy?"* I’ll be coding, then suddenly start looking for and applying to US companies, then go back to coding, then wonder, *"Wait, don't I love community businesses?"*

Fundamentally, I can analyze this as a loss of interest in my current work. The next step is to analyze *why* that interest dropped, which is a bit complex. Let’s break it down one by one.

**First**, it seems to stem from the act of doing something alone. These days, over 60% of my "conversations" are with **Claude Code** (the AI model). For someone like me who loves talking to people, this naturally drains my interest.

**Second** is the anxiety over my bank balance and when I can return to the US. Honestly, my balance has never been "good." The US is a hurdle not just because of the visa, but also because of the living costs. I used to think, *"I'll just make a great product and get investment,"* but lately, I feel suffocated wondering if a solo team can even get funded.

Before moving to the third point, one might ask: *"Then why not just find a co-founder?"* Through my experience, I’ve realized one thing: **I never want to find a co-founder out of desperate functional necessity.** I don't want to choose a partner just because I "need" a specific skill. I watched a video on the *DemoDay* YouTube channel about co-founders, and it resonated deeply. It said: *Don't look for a marriage partner just because they are a good cook and you can't cook for yourself.* A person you'll spend 5 or 10 years with should be someone whose way of communicating and viewing the world aligns with yours. So, even though I'm in a situation where I need a co-founder, paradoxically, I don't want to rush it.

**Third**, the previous two reasons lead to a somewhat "dissolute" lifestyle. Drinking with friends, oversleeping, watching YouTube... I’ve been spending a lot of unproductive time. The awareness that I’m wasting time makes me feel even smaller. This is what I’m trying to focus on most right now: **Maintaining a healthy routine.**

Regarding "interest"—many people advise that if you're going to start a business, do something that makes your heart race. This creates an easy exit: if what I'm doing now isn't heart-pounding, I should quit. But I ask myself: *Even if I love something, will it stay exciting for 10 years straight?* Won't there be at least ten moments where I want to give up?

In the end, I suspect that phrases like "doing what makes your heart race" are just rationalizations we use to protect our mental state. When I was young, I loved games so much I wanted to be a pro gamer, but when I saw friends preparing for it, they looked miserable. I experienced how an interest disappears once it's tied to "money."

I don't believe anything is happy all the time. Since entrepreneurship is fundamentally hard, what I need to do now is simple: **Focus 100% on my current potential customers.** With that, I settle my heart once more and wrap up the day.

P.S. I’m currently reading *Passing Through Failure*. It’s truly great. It feels like seeing a preview of the result I want to achieve through this blog. Maybe in 10 years, I can publish *Passing Through Failure Vol. 2: The US Startup Challenge Version*.
