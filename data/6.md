Until about three years ago, I loved self-help books: *The One Thing, Zero to One, The Right It,* etc. I read life lessons from successful founders and famous scientists and thought, "I should live like this or that."

Starting about a year ago, I began to prefer humanities or diaries that capture someone's raw struggles. That’s how I picked up the book *Passing Through Failure*. My friends on Instagram had shared that it was good, so I started reading it without much hesitation.

I had heard of the service "Publy," but I had never used it. This allowed me to read the book without any bias. I empathized deeply and realized that I, too, might face various situations described in the book.

The part I resonated with most was the talk about **sharing stories**. I hope all the posts I leave on this blog will be helpful to future entrepreneurs. While I also use this to organize my messy thoughts, I want to share the process—the thoughts, the obstacles, and how I overcame them. I believe this serves as a good reference for those who wish to walk the same path.

Here are some sentences from the book that stuck with me:

* *"We think we want to improve for ourselves and the world, but in most cases, that's not true. What we really want is to experience the gap between expectation and actual results. We feel satisfaction and achievement when the result is better than expected."* I often wonder what I truly want. My conclusion is that what I "think" I want might just be what society wants from me.
* *"To diagnose a system or yourself, you need the ability to distance yourself from what is happening now. If you keep dancing on the ballroom floor, you only see the people dancing with you. But if you go up to the balcony, you start to see a very different view of the ballroom."* This highlights the need for reflection through walks or meditation. While digging deep into tasks, we must maintain a broad perspective on what to focus on.
* *"If there is something you desperately want to achieve, you must jump into the middle of it boldly, even if people call you rude or aggressive. No one else will solve your problems for you. You shouldn't have the luxury of 'peace of mind' for no reason."*
* *"When you 'try' anything, you must have a deadline and a goal. Only then can you judge that attempt."*
* *"When the pool water drains, you can see who was swimming naked."* Everything is fine when things are going well. The core is when things are bad. The essence of a relationship is revealed in the most unexpected, worst-case scenarios.
* *"If there is no profit, your business is not a business. If there is no profit, it is not a company." "Maximize revenue, minimize expenses."*
