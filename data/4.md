# Entrepreneurial Philosophy 1: On Advice

I say this often lately: while trying to build a business, I feel like I’m becoming a philosopher rather than an entrepreneur. When I see a couple laughing happily with their child at a mall, I wonder, "Is that the happy life?" Other times, when someone recognizes my silent walk on a lonely path, I wonder, "Is *this* the happy life?" That’s how I’m becoming a philosopher.

Though I haven’t achieved great business results over the past two years of challenge, I’ve met many great people. I want to talk about what I’ve learned from them and my experiences.

**Regarding Advice:**
Entrepreneurship, by nature, has a very low probability of success. Entrepreneurs start knowing this. A low success rate means that most "common" advice won't work. No one else has experienced the exact same path I am taking. Even among entrepreneurs, everyone walks their own path in different situations. It’s quite similar to dating.

Therefore, the essence of advice is, in fact, **comfort**. I think it’s similar to religion. By speaking my thoughts and hearing what I want to hear, I gain the energy to take the next step.

People say there is no "right answer" in the world, but I’d rather say there are *so many* right answers that it feels like there are none. If you go to a bookstore now, you can easily find ten books that all say different things about happiness and life.

Nevertheless, if someone's words keep weighing on your mind, you need to look within yourself. Deep down, it might be something you actually wanted.
