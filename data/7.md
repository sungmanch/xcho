Whenever I talk to friends lately, the movie *Arrival* (released as *Contact* in some Korean contexts) often comes up. Since everyone recommended it, I finally watched it, and it left me with so much to think about. Before I dive into external interpretations or discuss it further with others, I want to record my immediate thoughts.

The most lingering part for me is how the protagonist, despite being able to see her future, chooses to accept and live through her current life. I am currently living the life of an entrepreneur. Jensen Huang once said: *"If I knew how hard being an entrepreneur would be, I wouldn't have chosen this path."* Since I haven't experienced many extreme hardships yet and it hasn't been that long, it might be an easy question for me to answer right now. Still, it’s a profound dilemma: **Can you embrace your present life even when you already know the future?**

The movie also depicts power games. The countries with overall decision-making power are China and the US. The world moves according to their decisions. Even now, in 2025, the reality doesn't seem much different.

Fundamentally, humans feel hostility toward a species different from us—aliens. This probably stems from the assumption that they are more evolved and stronger than we are. Even when they haven't taken any hostile action, the world falls into chaos out of anxiety and launches a preemptive strike. Except for movies like *E.T.*, aliens have almost always been portrayed as enemies. Is this a primal, animalistic anxiety toward a being more powerful than oneself?
