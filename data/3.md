# Entrepreneurial Philosophy 2: Essence

There’s a phrase that often appears in Elon Musk’s interviews regarding **First Principles**. He loves the laws of physics. Everything in the world goes through a process: **Ignorance -> Discovery -> Contemplation.** We remain ignorant of things we aren't interested in. For me, that might be fishing, golf, or maybe American football. When interest sparks, we go through a stage of "discovery." For example: "Americans really follow stop signs," "I always put more weight on my right foot during squats," or "I tried running and it’s fun."

From there, if my interest grows deeper, I want to solve my curiosity. *Why* do Americans follow stop signs so well? *Why* do I put more weight on my right foot? By asking "Why?" and answering it, you eventually reach the **essence**. And at the end of that essence, the laws of physics exist. I think this is why Elon Musk loves physics. In any field, if your contemplation and thoughts go deep enough, you find the essence.

Usually, if our circumstances don't change, our thoughts don't change much either. However, if our environment changes, our mental frameworks can collapse quite easily. This is where we must reconsider the word "essence." Essence is a word that should be able to describe who I am, even when the situation around me changes completely.

This is why business and entrepreneurship are so difficult. The surrounding situation changes constantly. The hardest part is that it becomes difficult to find who "I" really am.

You might have experienced this: you no longer like a food you loved as a child, or you used to love winter but now you love summer. Now, imagine these changes happening on a daily basis. It would be incredibly confusing. Am I a person who likes winter? Do I like chicken or salad? If your identity changed every 24 hours, imagine the chaos. To me, entrepreneurship is exactly like that.

Returning to the main point, realizing my essence is both crucial and difficult. I don’t have the answer yet, but I believe that experiencing diverse things helps. I am trying to increase my "diversity." I’m heading back to the US this February.
