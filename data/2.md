# Nonce (Dec 2023 – Dec 2025)

I am wrapping up my life at Nonce after about two years. Since some friends are also leaving Nonce in 2026, we all gathered for a farewell trip (MT). I’m sharing a video made by Won-gyun, our "golden-handed" friend, who put this together immediately after we returned. (Link: https://youtu.be/QEYN6rJ-cGo)

In December 2023, I started living at Nonce because I wanted to be surrounded by people taking unique and reckless challenges. I met people who were incredibly welcoming to strangers. I adjusted quickly, sharing many conversations over meals and drinks. I spent one year as a house manager at Villa 2 and another year as a member of Villa 3.

I love the prefix **"Co."** *Co-working, Co-living.* Doing something together brings immense happiness to a human being. This is especially true for me, as a 100% "E" (Extrovert) personality. Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about how happiness is a feeling that can only truly be felt "together." An expensive house, a luxury car, or fine dining means nothing if you are living in this world alone. I think the reason I want a nice house is that I want to share a better space with my family and friends. Expensive food tastes better when eaten with others rather than alone.

The management team, including Young-se, is truly sincere about this community. They care more about making Nonce a better community than about their salaries or work-life balance. From a cold business perspective, one might see Nonce as an unattractive venture. Paradoxically, however, amazing companies are being built here. Companies with over $25M (30B KRW) in funding are emerging, and new "Baby Unicorns" are growing rapidly.

The friends here are all walking their own paths in their own ways. A 20-year-old starting a business, someone wanting to contribute to the creator economy, people running agencies to create cash flow, and someone risking everything to start a business in the US. These diverse people share the same side dishes at one table and exchange their thoughts.

I believe it’s vital to make one’s own "well" deep and wide. There are many friends here who have "wells" of different shapes and sizes. Through them, my own well has become wider and deeper. My well deepened thanks to friends who constantly questioned me: "Why do you start a business?" or "Why do you need to go to the US?"

2025 was quite eventful for me, but through conversations with the people I "Co-lived" with, I was able to overcome many things and gain precious realizations.
