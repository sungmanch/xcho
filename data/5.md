# Product Diary: 5th Product, TruVi (Mar 2025 ~ )

After setting our hypothesis, our task was clear: **Sales (Inbound + Outbound) + Product Building.** I’ve recently solidified this thought: as an early-stage entrepreneur, you must excel at these two things. The Flywheel for acquiring users (Sales & Marketing, but specifically Sales in the early stages) and the Flywheel for satisfying those users (Product Building + User Interviews). I believe the essence of business is keeping these two flywheels spinning.

Since we were a two-person team, we decided to split roles. Previously, we did everything—coding and sales—together. We learned one thing: because we are both engineers, we are good at building but bad at sales. Entrepreneur friends at a hacker house in the US once asked us, "Why aren't you doing sales immediately?" We replied, "We need a certain level of product to make conversations easier, and since we're confident in building, we can show it soon." Then they asked, "What you're building is just an MVP, it'll be incomplete anyway. You'll have to do sales after that regardless, so why not just do sales now?" We couldn't give a confident answer.

This time, we took parallel tracks: I focused on sales, and my partner focused on development. The product was divided into two: the tool for interview candidates and the tool for interviewers. I focused on outbound sales and the candidate side, while my co-founder focused on inbound sales and the interviewer side.

My goal was simple: find the **ICP (Ideal Customer Profile)**, set up an interview, and try to sell the product. I watched YC Startup School videos ("How to talk to users," "How to get your first customer") 3-4 times to get a feel for it and started outreach immediately. The result was the 30 interviews mentioned in Part 1. For those interested, I contacted them every time the product was updated to ask for feedback.

About a week later, I attended an HR event nearby. We had been skipping networking to focus on building and sales, but we attended this one because it was HR-specific. Networking in San Francisco is simple. The first line is usually: *"Hi, I'm Sungman. What are you building?"* No one cares about your age, affiliation, or school.

I spoke with the speakers, and one of them, after listening for just two minutes, said they wanted to use it—and pay for it. It was heart-pounding, but since it was only a two-minute talk, I worried they might not actually use it. However, they were a YC08 alum who had sold a company to Google, which gave me some confidence. I sent an email after the event and scheduled a call after returning to Korea.

During the call, my goal was to show a demo and confirm the intent to buy. But the person said they didn't need a demo—they just wanted the product sent over. I said I needed a little more time and would send it soon.

However, time slipped away. We hit financial limits and started doing freelance work, losing focus on the product. To make matters worse, my co-founder left the team. I realized then that many human judgments are driven by the "situation." What we call "fun" might be determined by the circumstances. If you love the piano but can never play it well, can you keep finding it fun? If you love entrepreneurship but every item you challenge fails, can you stay certain? My answer is **NO**. The situation determines so much, yet humans try to rationalize it later, saying "It wasn't what I truly wanted." I had these thoughts a lot after parting with my co-founder. My confidence dropped, and the future looked bleak. I even questioned for the first time: "Do I really want to do this?"

What pulled me back was the contact from the company I had called in Korea. I hadn't reached out for 2-3 months after the last call. One day, they messaged: "When is your product finished? I want to use it. If you're not making it, tell me who your competitor is." I gained so much motivation from that. Now, their CTO is using the product and giving feedback, and I am in the process of reflecting that.

When I first sent the product, there was no reply. I was discouraged. But with a "nothing to lose" mindset, I followed up once more: "It's okay if you don't use it. But I am sincere about this product. Please just give me feedback. It would help me immensely in my entrepreneurial journey." That's how I got the CTO's reply.

I’ve rambled on, but I think I’ve realized three big things:
1. **The essence of business** is attracting more users and improving the product to satisfy them.
2. **Certainty** is harder to maintain than you think. For a founder, many people and situations feel like enemies. Fixing the situation one by one helps maintain that certainty.
3. **Desperation is shown through action.** Imagining and calculating probabilities in your head doesn't help. If you are desperate, you act. Thinking "Is this rude?" or "Can I do this?" is proof that you aren't desperate enough yet.
