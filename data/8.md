Lately, to relieve some of the suffocating pressure, I’ve been seeking out experienced seniors. Talking to those who have walked the path before me is immensely helpful for my mental state. I gained strength by meeting a mentor who has been running a community business for 10 years, another who has been an entrepreneur for 7 years, and one who built influence in Korea and is now challenging the US market. It’s like hiking a mountain and asking someone coming down, *"Is there much further to go?"* When they say, *"Not much left,"* you find the strength to keep climbing.

I looked back at when I first had the ambition to enter the US market. It was a choice that could have depleted all my savings, but excitement outweighed fear. Talking to American friends, I felt like I could truly change the world. As a native Korean, I was full of desire to build influence in American society. I wanted to go out there, change things, and share that story. I believed that such a story would inspire another challenger, then another, eventually making Korean society better. That was my life goal.

That goal remains the same today. However, I think I was looking for an easy way. I wasn't necessarily exhausted, but I was confused. I’m tightening my resolve once more and moving forward. Adios!
