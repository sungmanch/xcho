# 2025 Retrospective. FXXXK YOU

As the final days of December approach, I’ve kept the thought of writing a retrospective in the back of my mind. I kept putting it off, using "being busy" as an excuse. It is now around 4:00 AM on December 30th. With the amber glow of indirect lighting, a jazz playlist in the background, and a can of beer in hand, I naturally found myself opening my laptop and hitting the keys.

2025 was a year filled with many events. It’s been two years since I started my journey in entrepreneurship. On YouTube, in books, and on social media, I see people talking about how hard they worked and how much they achieved. Unfortunately, I don’t feel I can give myself that kind of praise for this past year. It feels like I’ve caught a disease where I’m incapable of complimenting myself.

Looking back at 2025 as it comes to a close, what stands out most is the change in me as a person. I’ve become someone who doesn't care much about what others say. I haven’t achieved business success yet. Nevertheless, I am incredibly satisfied with the experiences I am going through. I am getting to know myself better, and I am learning to love the person I am.

In this retrospective, I don’t want to write about how hard I worked or what "cool" results I achieved—how many hours I slept, how many hours I worked, or how much money I made. I want to write about something else. I want to record how a person who simply loved people, drinking, and social gatherings was preoccupied with different thoughts on December 30, 2025. I’ve resolved to spend the upcoming January and February more quietly and in more solitude than ever before. More than ever, I hate listening to people around me talk about their version of the "right answer." In terms of the **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)**, I believe this is the period where my own signal is the clearest.

It’s been about two years since I distanced myself from everything Korean society expects: marriage, real estate, and a "stable" life. My bank account is getting emptier. Yet, surprisingly, my life is deeply satisfying. We often use the things that most people want as a yardstick to divide happiness from misery. We don't think about what truly makes *us* happy or miserable; we judge based on societal standards: Seoul over the provinces, expensive cars, expensive houses, designer clothes.

No one in the world is in the exact same situation as me. No societal standard can represent or explain my unique context. So, I’ll just do whatever I want. Even my parents and my closest friends cannot fully understand me. Therefore, I will walk the path I desire. To those who stand in my way, I’ll shout **"FXXXK YOU"** and keep moving forward.
