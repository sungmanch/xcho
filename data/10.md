# Essence

I had a conversation with a junior I knew from an entrepreneurship club. He already has much more experience in the startup scene than I do, and through our Q&A, I gained many insights. I want to organize these thoughts in writing.

When we think of words like business, entrepreneurship, or startup, many related terms come to mind: co-founding, investment, revenue, advertising, etc. But one thing remains constant amidst all these variables: **The essence of a good business is a good product.** It’s not a prestigious VC, millions in funding, or members with fancy degrees. A good product drives everything else.

A "good product" means your customers become enthusiasts who pay to use it every day (or with high frequency). They voluntarily become ambassadors for your product. Therefore, the absolute necessity for building a good product is **talking to your customers**—understanding them. Everything else is noise. All thought processes must stem from the root of "the product."

* **Investment:** Fundamentally, receiving investment is akin to taking on debt. Unless there is a specific reason, doing business while in debt is not a rational choice. Specific reasons include: 1. High initial product costs, 2. The ability to create explosive growth through leverage (debt).
* **Co-founders:** People usually talk about intelligence, passion, honesty, runway, and equity. The essence here is **trust.** A good team is one that solves problems efficiently within limited resources. "Efficiency" here assumes a distribution of work based on mutual trust. In a sports team, not everyone can be an all-rounder. The direction must be led by the head coach. This only works in a team where trust is the premise.
* **Networking:** The logic is the same. Unless it’s an unavoidable situation (like needing investment or a co-founder), it deviates from the essence of business. To run a good business, you shouldn't spend time networking; you should listen to customers and build a great product. If the product is great, high-quality networking will naturally follow.
